Welcome to Kafka Connect Connectors's documentation!
====================================================

`Kafka Connect <https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#introduction>`_ is a fault tolerant framework for running
connectors and tasks to pull data into and out of a Kafka Cluster. It is essentially the
`E <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extract,_transform,_load#Extract>`_ and `L <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extract,_transform,_load#Load>`_
of `ETL <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extract,_transform,_load>`_. Kafka Connect allows connectors and tasks to be spread
across a grouping of machines for increased throughput and resiliency.

This project is a collection of connectors and transforms that can be leveraged to build a realtime ETL pipeline.
