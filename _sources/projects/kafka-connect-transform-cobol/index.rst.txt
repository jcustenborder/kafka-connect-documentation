==============================
Cobol Copybook Transformations
==============================

The plugin contains transformations that are used to read binary data that is encoded as a Cobol copybook to structured data that is native Kafka Connect. For example this functionality could be used to convert data from Cobol copybooks to JSON or Avro when utilizing the proper Converter.


.. WARNING::
    This project is still in an experimental phase.


.. IMPORTANT::
    This project needs data for unit testing. Any copybook definitions with corresponding example data will greatly aid the overall quality of this project. If you can provide some example(s) please open an issue.
