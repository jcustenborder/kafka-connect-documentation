com.github.jcustenborder.kafka.connect.transform.xml.FromXml

    This transformation is used to read XML data stored as bytes or a string and convert the XML to a structure that is strongly typed in connect. This allows data to be converted from XML and stored as AVRO in a topic for example. 


.. TIP::
    XML schemas can be much more complex that what can be expressed in a Kafka Connect struct. Elements that can be expressed as an anyType or something similar cannot easily be used to infer type information.
