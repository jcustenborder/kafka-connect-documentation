After changing this to use the UrlClass loader it caused more issues where each class loader had their own Connectable class. Changed the Url class loader that is loading the xjc classes to include class loader the connector is using as the parent. This ensures that the Connectable class will be loaded from the parent class loader and only once. Fixes #4. (#10)"
