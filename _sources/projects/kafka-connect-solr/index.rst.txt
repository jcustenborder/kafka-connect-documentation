Apache Solr
===========

Installation through the `Confluent Hub Client <https://docs.confluent.io/current/connect/managing/confluent-hub/client.html>`_.

.. code-block:: bash

    confluent-hub install jcustenborder/kafka-connect-solr:latest

The SOLR connector is a high speed mechanism for writing data to `Apache Solr <http://lucene.apache.org/solr/>`_.


.. TIP::
    If you are seeing error messages such as `Invalid version (expected 2, but 60) or the data in not in 'javabin' format` compare the version of the Solr Server against the version of solrj the connector is compiled with. This error message is most likely due to a version mismatch between the server and solrj. To address this try replacing the solr-solrj-*.jar packaged with the connector with the version that matches the Solr server you are connecting to.
