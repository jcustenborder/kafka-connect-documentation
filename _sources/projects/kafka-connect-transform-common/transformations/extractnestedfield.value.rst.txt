Configuration

.. csv-table:: Configuration
    :header: "Name", "Type", "Importance", "Default Value", "Validator", "Documentation"
    :widths: auto

    "input.inner.field.name","String","High","","","The field on the child struct containing the field to be extracted. For example if you wanted the extract `address.state` you would use `state`."
    "input.outer.field.name","String","High","","","The field on the parent struct containing the child struct. For example if you wanted the extract `address.state` you would use `address`."
    "output.field.name","String","High","","","The field to place the extracted value into."

Property based example
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


This configuration is used typically along with `standalone mode
<http://docs.confluent.io/current/connect/concepts.html#standalone-workers>`_.

.. code-block:: properties

    name=connector1
    tasks.max=1
    connector.class=com.github.jcustenborder.kafka.connect.transform.common.ExtractNestedField$Value
    # The following values must be configured.
    input.inner.field.name=
    input.outer.field.name=
    output.field.name=



^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Rest based example
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


This configuration is used typically along with `distributed mode
<http://docs.confluent.io/current/connect/concepts.html#distributed-workers>`_.
Write the following json to `connector.json`, configure all of the required values, and use the command below to
post the configuration to one the distributed connect worker(s).

.. code-block:: json

    {
        "name": "connector1",
        "config": {
            "connector.class": "com.github.jcustenborder.kafka.connect.transform.common.ExtractNestedField$Value",
            "input.inner.field.name":"",
            "input.outer.field.name":"",
            "output.field.name":"",
        }
    }

Use curl to post the configuration to one of the Kafka Connect Workers. Change `http://localhost:8083/` the the endpoint of
one of your Kafka Connect worker(s).

.. code-block:: bash

    curl -s -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' --data @connector.json http://localhost:8083/connectors
